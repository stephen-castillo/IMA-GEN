## Description
Welcome to our AI Image Generator! This innovative app harnesses the power of OpenAI's cutting-edge deep learning models to generate stunning and one-of-a-kind images. As a logged-in user, you can explore a cluster page where you'll find a collection of AI-generated images created by both you and other users.

On the cluster page, you have the ability to search through the diverse range of user-created images. If you come across an image you love, you can easily download it and add it to your personal collection. Additionally, you have the option to visit the create page, where you can unleash your creativity and generate your own unique images using the AI models.

Feeling spontaneous? Simply click the "Surprise Me" button to discover a selection of pre-defined prompts that will inspire the AI to generate captivating images for you. Each prompt will result in a different and exciting creation, ensuring endless possibilities for artistic expression.

Our app incorporates essential features such as user authentication to protect your account and ensure a secure experience. We've also implemented environmental variable protection and deployed the app on Heroku for seamless and reliable performance.

Get ready to embark on an imaginative journey with our AI Image Generator and unleash your creativity like never before. Start exploring, creating, and discovering the limitless potential of AI-generated images today!
